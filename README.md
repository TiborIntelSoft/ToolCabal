ToolCabal
=========

Extending Cabal with Plugins, Preprocessors and Multi-target Compilers

This is an alpha version and documentation is virtually non-existing.

Also functionality is very limited. only building executables using GHC is supported.

To test:
- build the tools library and toolCabal executable (using cabal)
- run toolCabal in the TestProject folder

A beta version, including documentation and usage guide, will be released by September 6. Both here as on Hackage.
